# Chaser_Light_Project💡✨

This Arduino project demonstrates multiple LED blink sequences using digital pins 2 to 13. The LEDs blink in different patterns including one-by-one, reverse order, and all together, creating visually appealing effects.

## 🛠️ Components
- Arduino UNO
- 12 LEDs
- 12 resistors (220Ω)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

##  🌟Features
- Sequential LED blink
- Reverse sequential blink
- All LEDs blink together
- Easy to modify and expand

## How to Use▶️
1. Connect LEDs to pins 2–13 with resistors to GND.
2. Upload the Arduino code from the repository to the board.
3. Observe the LED patterns in action.

## Notes
- All code files are available in this repository.
- LED blink speed can be adjusted by modifying the delay value in the code.
